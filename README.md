# Budget Balance Tracking with tabula-py

#### Introduction
Managing and tracking budget line items and campus budgets can be a complex task, especially when dealing with data exported from accounting software in PDF format. The tabula-py package, a Python wrapper for tabula-java, simplifies this process by enabling efficient data extraction, cleaning, and manipulation from PDFs. This guide provides an overview of how to use tabula-py for budget balance tracking, including setup and key steps involved.

#### Summary
The tabula-py package allows users to extract data from PDFs, clean it, and manipulate it to track budget line items and campus budgets. It requires Java to be installed on your machine, and setting up the JAVA_HOME and PATH environment variables is essential for its operation. This guide covers the installation of OpenJDK, setting environment variables, and using tabula-py for budget tracking.

#### Middle Body

**1. Setting Up Java Environment**

To use tabula-py, you need to have Java installed on your machine. It's recommended to install OpenJDK and set the JAVA_HOME and PATH environment variables.

- **Installing OpenJDK**: Download and install OpenJDK from the official website.
- **Setting Environment Variables**:
  - **JAVA_HOME**: Points to the installation location of OpenJDK.
  - **PATH**: Points to the location of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM DLL).

You can set these variables in Python using the `os` package or permanently in the command prompt (Windows) or terminal (Mac).

```python
import os
os.environ['JAVA_HOME'] = 'path_to_openjdk'
os.environ['PATH'] += os.pathsep + 'path_to_jvm_dll'
```

**2. Installing tabula-py**

Install tabula-py using pip:

```bash
pip install tabula-py
```

**3. Extracting Data from PDFs**

Use tabula-py to extract data from PDFs. Here's an example of how to read a PDF file and convert it to a DataFrame:

```python
import tabula
df = tabula.read_pdf("path_to_pdf_file.pdf", pages='all')
```

**4. Cleaning and Manipulating Data**

Once the data is extracted, you can clean and manipulate it using pandas:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Example of cleaning data
df_cleaned = df.dropna()  # Remove missing values
df_cleaned.columns = ['Column1', 'Column2', 'Column3']  # Rename columns

# Example of manipulating data
df_grouped = df_cleaned.groupby('Column1').sum()  # Group by a column and sum values
```

**5. Tracking Budget Line Items**

With the cleaned and manipulated data, you can now track budget line items and campus budgets effectively. Use pandas to perform various analyses and generate reports as needed.

#### Conclusion
Using tabula-py for budget balance tracking simplifies the process of extracting, cleaning, and manipulating data from PDFs. By setting up the Java environment and leveraging the capabilities of tabula-py and pandas, you can efficiently manage and track budget line items and campus budgets. This approach not only saves time but also ensures accuracy in financial tracking and reporting.
